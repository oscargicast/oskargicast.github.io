Welcome to my personal blog. Many months ago I had that itchy feeling in my brain telling me
to create this blog. Why? The reasons are many, from sharing some development curiosities
to share some cooking tips. The main reason in this tiny space is SHARING.

Next steps
----------

I usually organize some of my goals on trello as you can see bellow. So I finally
take this time to setup [hugo](http://gohugo.io/) to make this basic blog. You can check
the repo on [github](https://github.com/oskargicast/oskargicast.github.io).

So I won't say goodbye cause this is just the beginning :)
